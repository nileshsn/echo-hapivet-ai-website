          <p>
            Hapivet was founded by a team of veterinarians and AI engineers who saw a critical gap in veterinary
            practice management. Vets spend more time on paperwork than patient careâ€”a problem we're solving with AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to empower veterinary clinics with intelligent automation, allowing them to focus on what
            they do best: caring for animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Hapivet is trusted by clinics across the country to streamline operations, reduce administrative
            burden, and improve patient outcomes.
